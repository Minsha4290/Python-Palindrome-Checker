# Python-Palindrome-Checker
The "Palindrome Checker" is a simple Python console based program that allows users to input a sentence and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The program provides feedback to the user about whether the entered sentence is a palindrome or not.

#### How to Use:
1. Run the Python script (`python palindrome_checker.py`) in a Python environment.
2. Enter a sentence when prompted.
3. The program will check if the entered sentence is a palindrome or not.
4. View the result and decide if you want to check another sentence.

#### Example:
```bash
Welcome! Please enter a sentence, and I will check if it is a palindrome or not.
level
Yay, it's a palindrome!

Do you want to check another sentence? (yes/no): yes

Welcome! Please enter a sentence, and I will check if it is a palindrome or not.
hello
No, it's not a palindrome.

Do you want to check another sentence? (yes/no): no
Goodbye!
```

#### Note:
This project is designed for simple and quick palindrome checking. Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance its functionality. Enjoy checking palindromes!
