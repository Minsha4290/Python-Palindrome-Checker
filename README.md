# Python-Palindrome-Checker
The "Palindrome Checker" is a simple Python console based program that allows users to input a sentence and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The program provides feedback to the user about whether the entered sentence is a palindrome or not.
